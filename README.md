The problem I’m trying to solve:

With inflation dominating recent economic and political conversations, the goal of this project was to
help with how people perceive inflation by analyzing how it actually behaves according to official data
from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This analysis is based on publicly available data, published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US
Census Bureau. My analysis demonstrates data manipulation (through cleaning of the data sets to index
average salary through the years to the average of 1984), visualization (graphs), and statistical modeling in
R (utilizing linear regression).
